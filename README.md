# Health Equity Hackathon
A NLPs service to provide basic directory of social and medical service
  providers in Missouri, include hours of operation and additional service
  categories.
  
# Summary
For this hackathon, competing teams of up to five people will utilize Amazon Comprehend to collect, analyze, and enrich IRS data about social and medical service providers throughout Missouri. Teams will be given access to the IRS data, supporting information about how to use the IRS data, pre-configured AWS resources for analyzing the IRS data, detailed requirements for submitting the enriched dataset, and criteria for how submissions will be evaluated. The resultant data will be used by Johego, a St. Louis-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity, to help connect people in need with the social and medical services they need.
