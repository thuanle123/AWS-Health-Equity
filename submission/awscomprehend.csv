TRES DIAS IS BASED ON THE BASIC CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES AND FOUNDATIONS. IT REVOLVES AROUND THREE DAYS OF TALKS OF LAITY AND CLERGY. EACH TALK IS DISCUSSED BY GROUPS OF TABLES. THE TRES DIAS ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF LOVE, JOY, CHRISTIAN COMPANIONSHIP, SINGING AND WORSHIP. ATTENDING AS A TRES DIAS CANDIDATE CAN ONLY BE DONE ONCE. THEREFORE, IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE CHURCH, BUT AS A TRAINING TO BE A GREAT SERVANT LEADER IN YOUR OWN CHURCH. TRES DIAS IS A WEEKEND FOR ADULTS THAT FOCUSES ON YOU AND THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS CHRIST. WHILE TRES DIAS EXPLORES THE BASIC BELIEFS OF CHRISTIANITY, IT IS BEST DESCRIBED AS A SPIRITUAL ENCOUNTER WITH CHRIST. MANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE ATTENDED THE WEEKEND EXPRESSED THAT THEY RECEIVED A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST AND A MORE MEANINGFUL, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT."

The Organization is motivated by a vision in which collaboration among community leaders across healthcare, education, business, government, philanthrophy and other sectors is the cultural norm for creating and leading healthy communities that systematically address root causes of social determinants impacting health and well being.During the Organizations's two year pilot phase (2014-2015), the Organization has identified three communities that intend to serve as pilot settings for the testing and implementation of the Communities of Excellence framework. During this pilot phase, the organization has engaged in cross-sector collaboration within the pilot communities to implement the framework which was adapted from the Baldridge Criteria for Performance Excellence. This process has involved meetings with various local officials and leaders for the purpose of providing training, mentoring, skill-building, research, knowledge of best practices, and financial and coaching resources in assisting the communities in establishing community criteria for quality, goals, measuring progress and criteria for sustainability. The Organization has engaged the services of a consultant for purposes of coordinating and implementing these actions. Expenses incurred have been primarily for compensation of the consultant and related travel and training expenses. In 2017 an initial conference of participating communities was held for the purpose of furthering the above mentioned objectives."

Activities and support vary by family, and our average budget is $4,000 per family, spent on activities, outings, materials, and vendor costs. Our organization began helping families whose loved one is going through cancer treatment by giving the family One Great Day, and through this experience we learned about families' need for on-going support and continuous care. Through our experiences in delivering a Great Day to so many families, we discovered the need for on-going support. Our Helping Hands Support Program responds to this need by providing continuous care for 3 months or 6 months while they undergo cancer treatment. This plan provides continuous support around the house for a family while their loved one goes through chemotherapy treatment. We've partnered up with some of the best providers in St. Louis to offer professional cleaning, landscaping, and meal preparation services. With our support plan in place, the family will never have to worry about a clean house, unkempt lawn, or missed meal again while their loved one is going through treatment. The average cost is $2,500 per family for a 3-month support program. This number doubles to over $5,000 when we provide 6-months of support."
